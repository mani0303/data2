== Why Use Mail Mint? ==
Email marketing is still the best way to get more leads and drive more sales. However, when creating marketing funnels, you have to go back and forth between multiple tools to run successful campaigns.

You collect leads with one tool, plan the funnel journey in another, create your funnel pages with another, and then run email automation in yet another tool. So, just to create a single campaign, you have to learn and spend time with so many tools.

With Mail Mint, you longer need to go back and forth with multiple tools.

For starters, the plugin has its own lead form builder, which will allow you to collect leads from anywhere on your website. You can then segment your leads and organize them to run targeted email campaigns.

Moreover, it has direct integration with WordPress, WooCommerce, and EDD for contact management and automation workflows.

You can easily plan and run automation flows in the same tool while also running email campaigns and sequences based on your marketing needs.

But that‚Äôs not all. Mail Mint has a special integration with WPFunnels to help you build funnels like you have never done before. You will be able to plan and craft complete funnel journeys, including funnel pages and email automation flows, on a single visual canvas.

This means if you have both Mail Mint and WPFunnels, you will be able to create your funnels in one place without losing track of your funnel journey. And eventually, you will be able to launch successful funnel campaigns faster and get more results.

= üëâ Dynamic Segmentation =
